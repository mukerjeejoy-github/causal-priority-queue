   ```
4. **Make Your Changes** â€“ Implement your feature, fix, or improvement.
5. **Test Your Changes** â€“ Ensure your code is functional and does not introduce errors.

###  Branch Protection & Review Process
To maintain code quality, the `main` branch is protected. This means:
- **No one (including maintainers) can push directly to `main`.**
- **All changes must go through a pull request and be reviewed before merging.**
- **At least one approval is required before merging a PR.**

2. **Open a New Issue** with:
   - A clear title & description.
   - Steps to reproduce (for bugs).
   - Expected behavior vs. actual behavior.

For general discussions and feature ideas, use the [Discussions Tab](https://github.com/mukerjeejoy-github/causal-priority-queue/discussions).

- **Follow Pythonâ€™s PEP 8 style guide.**
- **Include docstrings for functions and classes.**
